# Pokemon: A Sequel Coming In Inevitably

Project made in Java for LPOO class inspired by Pokemon Fire Red/Leaf Green games from Gameboy Advance.

Made in colaboration with [Ana Inês](https://github.com/anaines14)  

## Development

### Graphics

We initially convert a .png image to text, using `img2txt`, a program from [libcaca](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca). That program generates a .svg that we parse and then draw using Lanterna.

## Features to Implement

- [ ] Make the main character appear in-game and be controllable (with arrow keys).  
- [ ] Implement three pokémons (starters) with fixed moves and abilities (but without leveling up).
- [ ] Make it possible to catch pokémon or battle against it.

## Notes

- Our game would have only one level, that would consist in a open field with grass in which pokémon would appear
