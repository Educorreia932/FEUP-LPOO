# LPOO_40 - Pok√©mon: A Sequel Coming In Inevitably

Our game consists, as the title states, in a *mock* version of the RPG Pok√©mon series, more specific, the Fire Red/Leaf Green games from Gameboy Advance.  

In it, the player will be able to catch and battle with pok√©mons in tall grass, try to catch them or even battle them with other their own pok√©mon.

The protagonist is a young boy who goes on a journey to be the very best pok√©mon trainer like no one ever was. üéµ

 In order to achieve his goal, the player will have to catch pok√©mon and battle other trainers. Whenever he wins a battle its pok√©mon gain experience points and when they gather a certain amount of experience, they level up or even evolve.  

This project was developed by [*Eduardo Correia*](https://github.com/educorreia932) (up201806433@fe.up.pt) and [*Ana In√™s Barros*](https://github.com/anaines14) (up201806593@fe.up.pt) for LPOO 2019/2020.

- **Pok√©mon Appearing in Tall Grass** - When the player walks trough grass, they may encounter a wild pok√©mon and if so a battle with it will start. 

### Pok√©mon

- **Pok√©mon Types** - These are properties of pok√©mon and their moves. A pok√©mon may have up to two types, while a move only has one.

</p>

- **Type Effectiveness** - When a pok√©mon uses a move, the damage it will cause to the adversary pok√©mon will depend on the move's type and the other pok√©mon's type(s).   
A super effective attack will cause 2x the damage, a not very effective will cause 0.5x the damage and a no effect will cause 0x damage.  
For instance, the Water type is super effective against Fire, so if a Water pok√©mon move is used against a Fire pok√©mon, it would cause two times the normal damage it would cause.

### Battle

- **HP and Experience Bar** - These bars represent, respectively, the total health percentage of a pok√©mon in-battle and its experience progress from its current level to the next.

- **Battle Options Menu** - While in-battle the player has four options of what to do.  
    - **Fight** - Make the pok√©mon use move.
    - **Bag** - Use an item from the bag.
    - **Pok√©mon** - Change that's pok√©mon currently fighting for another one on the party.
    - **Run** - Try to flee from the battle.

## Design

## Graphics

We initially convert a .png image to text characters, using `img2txt`, a program from [libcaca](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca). That program generates a .svg that we parse and then draw using Lanterna.
